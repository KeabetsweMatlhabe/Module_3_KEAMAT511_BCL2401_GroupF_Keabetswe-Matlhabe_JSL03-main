# [JSL03] Project Submission: Which one is which? Declarative or Imperative?!

# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: 1

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
   1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Start by explaining the code logic in the imperative approach.
      - Mention each step of the process in the code.
      - Describe how the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
      - Discuss the use of variables to track the state and progress of the process.

   2. **Emphasis on How:** Highlight how the imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished.
      - Point out the use of loops, conditions, and explicit instructions.
      - Discuss any mutable variables or states that change during execution.


Example #: 2

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
   - Describe the cooking process in a high-level, abstract manner.
   - Emphasize that the code defines "what" should happen rather than "how" it should happen.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** Discuss the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.
   - Explain how the process steps are organized in a structured format.
   - Mention any abstraction layers or functions used to encapsulate actions.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
- Reflect on what you've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.
